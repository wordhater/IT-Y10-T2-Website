                    <p>
                        Malware is a piece of software that runs on a computer intended to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorised access to a computer system. Their purposes range greatly, from using your system resources for their own gain, to spying on your activities on your computer. This Page aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the types of malware and their intentions, providing examples and how to avoid them.
                        <br>
                        For example: A common misconception people have is that malware would be obvious if it were on their system, however this is not true for most types of malware, since in most cases it is counterproductive for the malware to be noticed and removed by the user.

                    <p>
from greek mythology, the Trojan horse was said to have been used by the greeks to attack a city. The horse was given to the enemy as a gift, however it contained soldiers that weakened the cities defense, allowing for further attacks.
                    <br></p><div class="side-image left animatable slideinright"><img src="Assets/Images/trojan-clipart.jpg" alt="Modern Trojan Horse"></div><p><br>
Trojans, in their modern form have changed a lot, however they still share some key similarities to the greek version. They are a form of malware that a user downloads with the thought that it's a legitimate file, instead it contains malware. Often these programs will function as if they were the real version of the software, only with the malware added to the file in the background. Their intentions can vary greatly, from spying on your activities and stealing passwords to creating backdoors into your computer where a hacker effectively has full control over your computer.

                    <p>
                        This form of malware has the primary intention too steal all manner of your personal information as you use your computer. This information can then be used for nefarious purposes such as financial gain through selling it or using collected passwords and credit card information. It spreads through many different means, meaning you should remain cautious of any suspicious email attachments and other downloads from the internet. Depending on the type it can collect data such as:

                        <li>Credit card details and account passwords: from the information collected by keylogging, an attacker can extract passwords and other sensitive information</li>
                        <li>web activity: collects the actions you make on the web, usually to serve you targeted ads</li>

                    <p>
                        Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and asks you to pay a ransom for these files to be decrypted once again, essentially holding you files for ransom. Paying the ransom, despite common belief will most likely result in you files returned. This is because, if ransomware never returned files, no one would pay the attackers and they would have no gain in performing these attacks. However, you should avoid paying the hacker, and there are some precautions you should take to avoid losing your files to ransomware. The primary combat against this form of attack is Backups, any form of backups is good but cold backups will be the most effective as they cannot be accessed by the malware, and often ransomware attacks all connected drives as well.

                        Not exactly malware, however it pretends to be. Usually in the form of a website, these display messages to the victim intended to scare them into downloading some software - aka another form of malware - to "fix your computer", call a scam call center or attempt to convince them that they have to pay a fee to remove the "virus". I've personally seen others run into these pages by accident and be fooled by their urgent wording. These are in some sense a form of scam however due to their appearance as malware, they can also be considered a form of malicious software.

                        Malware is usually from the internet so a perfect solution would be to not connect to the internet, however, that isin't really viable is it? Instead, there are measures that can be put in place to improve your security, these include using a content blocker browser extension such as ublock origin to hide and warn you about malicious sites and content when browsing the web, keeping your system and other installed software up to date to minimise vulnerabilities. Setting a BIOS password can also help to prevent a piece of malware infecting core components (firmware) of your computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Having an antivirus can help greatly, they can scan downloaded files for threats and warn you before they cause any harm to your files or personal information. Many can also remove some forms of malware.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To protect accounts, most platforms now support 2 factor authentication, a technology that sends an email containing a code to you to confirm it's really you. You probably already use this for many of your accounts (and probably have been quite annoyed by it, as I have), and for good reason too as a password leak or similar could happen and an attacker would need both your password and your email account to access your accounts.

                    <h1>How to Remove Malware</h1>
                    <p>
                        The most effective and safe means of getting rid of malware is to wipe all infected drives and your system after backing you data up (the backups could be infected), this removes almost all possible places the malware could be running or keeping data in. However, I realise this may not be viable for many people who either have lots of files and data or don't know how to reinstall an operating system. Instead you should attempt to use a reputable antivirus software to scan your system for threats and remove the discovered threats.
                        <br><br>
                        Remember the best way to deal with malware is prevention and not cure.
