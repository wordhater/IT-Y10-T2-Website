# Phishing

Phishing is a means that cyber criminals use to trick you into giving them personal information, this can be performed over email, messages, social media and any other means of communication. In many cases it can be challenging to spot and even come from someone you know online.

## How to spot it

There are usually some telltale signs around any Phishing attack these include:

<ul>
    <li>The senders name: often the username of the sender will have some slight changes such as an underscore instead of a space or number such as a 0 instead of an o</li>
    <li>The senders @domain: a fake email which pretends to be from a large company or government will usually have a standard domain such as @gmail.com instead of the business name or gov at the end</li>
    <li>Unusual links or link shorteners: the above points also apply to links contained within the message, most often legitimate emails will tell you to visit their website rather than send you a link</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
