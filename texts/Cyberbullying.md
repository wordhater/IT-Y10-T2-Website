# What is Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying is when someone else intentionally uses an online platform to harass another person. This can be done in many ways through harassment, threats and more. In the digital age it is imperative that we take note of these hazards for our own safety, and to create a more positive and sustainable internet for everyone.


## Why it's bad

Cyberbullying can cause harm in many ways, it impacts the mental health and well-being of victims, damages relationships and can sometime result in physical violence. Furthermore, with the ability to create new identities and fake names with the click of a button, cyberbullies can remain anonymous with far less effort than traditional bullies. Overall, this causes cyberbullying to be a major issue that should be taken seriously due to it's many impacts on young people.

## Harassment and Flaming

Online bullies will often attack a victim through sending repeated messages, emails, or posts intended to annoy or threaten the recipient. These messages can cause harm to the victim's mental health, leading to feelings of fear, anxiety and paranoia. Bullies may often perform these actions on publicly accessible pages too often referred to as flaming, these actions can have significant impacts to the victim as it brings others into the bullying which severely damages reputation and can lead to further forms of cyberbullying as it draws more bullies to join in attacking the individual, however it will also bring more positive attention to the situation.

This kind of bullying can lead to more severe forms of cyberbullying such as doxing.

## Doxing

If a cyberbully obtains personal information of their victim it can result in doxxing, which is when this information gets shared without ones consent, this information can include:

<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Contact Information</li>
    <li>Usernames on other online platforms</li>
    <li>Workplace or educational information</li>
    <li>Personal preferences</li>
</ul>

Release of this information can impact ones self esteem because imagine if you had that secret of your shared online as a means of humiliation. Furthermore, this can lead to more severe impacts on ones life such as identity theft, as the information need for another person to impersonate you is now publicly available. These attackers can now perform actions in your name which could result in various kinds of fraud impacting the victim financially. As these virtual interactions can create real-world consequences, it is imperative that we take action to help prevent these malicious activities from happening.

# How to prevent cyberbullying

Cyberbulllying can be hard to stop once it starts, many sites will recommend blocking the bully, however I personally don't see this being the only solution that is needed due to the nature of accounts and alts on these online platforms. So, what do I do you may ask? The remainder of this blog aims to answer that very question.

## Blocking

Blocking is often referred to as the primary means of stopping cyberbullying and in many cases will be successful. However, this method may not always be that shining bullet many make it out to be, the cyberbully could just make another account or even resort to posting publicly, worsening the situation.

## Ignoring

This is highly effective for most kinds of cyberbullying, since most bullies are looking for a reaction from you it causes their attempts to have little outcome for them and will move on. This method can be made more effective when paired with other preventative measures such as blocking the bully. However, ignoring public bullying on social media will often not help, due to the bully getting the attention they want from others commenting on these posts already.

## Telling other trusted people

Telling others about your situation is another commonly suggested method, however many do not feel that they have the power to speak about it, usually from the bullies giving threats that something will happen if you tell anyone. However, no matter how much they threaten that it it still safer to let others know about the situation, so that they deal with them before any further encounters. Even if you only tell your friends they can still help by providing support and contacting others that can deal with the bully.

## If you see others

If you see others being bullied online, report the activities to another trusted person, preferably a teacher or parent. Many schools have systems in place to anonymously report bullying on behalf of others, these platforms provide a secure environment for those wishing to report these people without becoming a target.

# Conclusion

Overall, cyberbullying is a significant hazard of the modern online world we live in, it is essential for individuals, societies and organisations to work together to foster an online culture of respect and to report and punish those doing wrong.
